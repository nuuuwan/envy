\section{One-to-Many Envy}

We will use $E_{i,\cdot}$ to denote the collective envy felt by Person $i$ for all other people in the population. We will assume that it is the normalize sum of Envy across the population. I.e.,

\begin{equation}
    E_{i,\cdot} = \frac{\sum_{j} E_{i,j}}{N}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the total number of people in the population.
