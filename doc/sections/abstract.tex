To \textit{envy} is to wish that you had something that another person has \cite{dictionary_cambridge_envy}.
There are no measures for quantifying the collective extent of envy prevenlt in a group (like a country). 
This paper attempts to define such a metric. 
As is the case with such cases, there are many assumptions and simplifications.
